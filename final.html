Title:  Penny – The Pisces: A Glimpse Being Penny!
Semester/Year: 2/2023
Software: After Effects and Audacity

    This is a pseudo-documentary showing a small example of what it is like to be Penny and having to deal with her inherent personality traits, such as her absent-mind and clumsiness, it also intends to show how they affect her even on small simple tasks, such as going to school. 
    Research about Astrology and how Zodiac Signs generally work was made to create the universe this character lives in. The inspiration comes from my interest in Astrology, as a Pisces-Sun myself, it was interesting to incorporate aspects of my own character traits enhanced in a character for comedic purposes. 
    The shots were recorded with an iPhone 13 Pro Max and uses Cinematic mode embedded camera in order to give blurry background effect to the recording.   All the footage was edited with Adobe – After Effects, including titles, captions, transition effects, sound mixing and credits. The narration/ voice over seen throughout the clip was recorded with voice notes with the same iPhone and, sound effects and mixing were edited with Audacity and then exported to After Effects. Pretty much everything that was planned on Storyboard was followed, except for planning of the shots (close-ups/ medium and wide shots were alternated to best fit the space where it was filmed).
