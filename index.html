	<h1>Penny- The Pisces</h1>
    <p> Penny is the only Pisces in her family of Virgos (her polar opposite sign). She has all the stereotypical character traits of a Piscean, being extremely clumsy (therefore the neck brace), absent minded, a romantic day-dreamer who falls in love easily, not to mention a creative thinker and natural story-teller. 

She constantly trips, forgets to tie her shoe-laces and keeps missing the bus to school because she is either late or takes the bus in the wrong direction. She is aloof with a heart of gold. People in her life are always mesmerized by her big imagination.
