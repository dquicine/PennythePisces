    <p> Penny - The Pisces is the only Pisces in her family of Virgos.Penny is the only Pisces of her family, she comes from a family of Virgos (her polar opposite sign). She has all the stereotypical character traits of a Piscean, she is extremely clumsy (therefore the neck brace), absent minded, romantic day-dreamer who falls in love easily. Also, a creative and natural story-teller. 

She constantly trips, forgets to tie her shoe-laces and keeps missing the bus to school because she is either late or takes the bus in the wrong direction. She is aloof with a heart of gold. People in her life are always mesmerized by her big imagination.
