<h1>Penny lives in Astroland</h1>
<p> Penny lives a suburban town named Astroland. It is a place where everyone is defined by their sun in Zodiac signs and, all the stereotypical character traits of the people who live in it are enhanced, as a superpower or weakness, for comedic purposes. My character lives in a relatively suburban town. Not a big, crowded city, but well enough developed. She lives with her family of 5, her mom, dad and her 3 siblings, the youngest who is 3, and her two older sisters who are 15 and 17. She lives in a typical suburban town where the weather changes according to what astrological season the “stars” are going through. For example, from March 21 to April 19 Astroland goes through a lot of big storms because the Sun is in Aries, a sign stereotypically seen as difficult and extremely stubborn and short tempered.  </p>
